# Mapping_Earthquakes
Build insightful visualizations with interactive features on earthquakes around the world

## Purpose
The Disaster Reporting Network, a non-profit company that provides data-driven storytelling on disasters around the world, aims to build insightful visualizations with interactive features on earthquakes around the world.  The map shows earthquakes that have occured within a 7-day period.  It draws earthquake information from the USGS website.  

The map is interactive with the following options:
- Tile Layers:
    - Streets
    - Satellite
    - Dark
- Overalys:
    - Tectonic Plates
    - Earthquakes \(all\)
    - Major Earthquakes \(earthquakes with a magnitude of 4.5 or higher)

The tectonic plates data comes from a GitHub user, fraxen (tectonicplates repository).
